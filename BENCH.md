# Perft

## Naive implementation with clone

### Depth 4 (inclusive)

`cargo run`

perf imm 4 = 197281 | correct: true
real    2m2,061s

`cargo run --release`

perf imm 4 = 197281 | correct: true
real    0m6,434s

**After en passant rule is added**
perf imm 4 = 197281 | correct: true
real	0m8,446s

**Parallel ver: After en passant rule is added**
perf imm 4 = 197281 | correct: true
real	0m1,687s

### Depth 5  (inclusive)

perf imm 5 = 4865351 | correct: false
real    2m37,604s

**After en passant rule is added**
perf imm 5 = 4865609 | correct: true
real	3m32,410s

**Parallel ver: After en passant rule is added**
perf imm 5 = 4865609 | correct: true
real	0m55,846s

**New parallel ver: After castling and en passant are added**

4 threads | perf imm 5 =    4865609 | correct: true | total time   49.77s
perf imm 5 =    4865609 | correct: true | total time   58.34s

### Depth 6  (inclusive)

**After en passant rule is added**
